This is unofficial Indahnya Islam Mobile App.

I'm using React Native through expo.io for this project. The code might not work because the React Native libraries now at newer versions, while this app works as it last written (20/08/2019). I've no intention to maintain this project since the reason I started it is to learn how to write apps using React Native. 

You may use this code to improve your knowledge or perhaps, make an improvement to this project. Whatever you do and if you intend to publish it, let me know. I'm more than excited to know about it! 😍
